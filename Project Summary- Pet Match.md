*** Project Summary- Pet Match***



"Pet Match - get matched with the right pet". This is not just our motto, instead, it is our deep belief that we as Pet Match can help to reduce the amount of returned pets to the shelters. For that, we analyzed the present situation which is taking place in many pet shelters nowadays and figured out the following problems:

● Failed adoptions mean pets were adopted and returned.
● People frequently return a pet because the pet was not what they expected.
● It is a huge problem for independent shelters that have to allocate resources for that returning pet.
● Pets are usually brought from other countries in Europe, so it’s even harder to return to the original shelter.
● Failed adoptions can traumatize pets even more.
● During a lock-down situation, people tend to adopt pets and harm them by returning them after such a lock-down. 

We at Pet Match are convinced that by analyzing the traits of a potential adopter and the behavior/characteristics of a pet, we can ensure a better matching by giving the potential adopter a recommendation based on a machine learning model which we deployed on a website.
